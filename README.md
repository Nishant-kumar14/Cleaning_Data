# Customer Personality Analysis 🧠📊
This project focuses on analyzing customer profiles to help businesses tailor their products and marketing strategies to specific customer segments.

## 📌 Objective
The goal is to explore and clean customer data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and uncover patterns related to spending behavior, demographics, and campaign responses.

## 🗂 Dataset

* Customer behavior: mntwines, mntmeatproducts, numwebpurchases

* Campaign response: acceptedcmp1 to acceptedcmp5, response

* Join date: dt_customer

* Web activity: numwebvisitsmonth

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Steps
